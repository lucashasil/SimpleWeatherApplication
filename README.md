# SimpleWeatherApplication
A python application which scrapes data from multiple weather APIs, including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the OpenWeatherMap API to monitor the weather for some desired location.

Features two modes, allowing for an enhanced user experience, with each mode as follows:
- Basic Mode: the basic mode simply monitors **every** capital city in Australia and periodically updates the displayed values for accurate real-time monitoring.
- Extended Mode: the extended mode allows a user to enter (almost) any desired city in the world, to obtain a detailed forecast for the current day and the next 5 days.
